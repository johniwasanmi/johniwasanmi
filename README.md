# üëã Hello, I'm John Iwasanmi (aka **PenDevOps**)

As a **penetration tester**, **developer**, and **DevOps enthusiast**, my mantra is simple: **"Code safe, build strong."** I believe that security and development go hand-in-hand, and my goal is to ensure that applications and systems are not only robust but resilient against any threat. With expertise in **Active Directory pentesting**, **secure code review**, and **DevSecOps**, I thrive on creating security solutions that empower development teams.

## üëÄ What I'm Interested In:
- **Active Directory Security**: Specializing in understanding, exploiting, and securing Active Directory environments, from privilege escalation to domain dominance.
- **Red Team Operations**: Simulating adversarial attacks to uncover and patch real-world vulnerabilities in corporate environments.
- **Web Application Security**: Securing both front-end and back-end frameworks like Django and React by finding and closing security gaps.


---

## üå± Currently Learning & Exploring:
- **Advanced Cloud Security**: Expanding knowledge in securing cloud infrastructures across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**, focusing on IAM policies, cloud storage protection, and workload security.

## üíº Core Skills & Expertise:
- **Active Directory Penetration Testing**:
  - Expertise in **privilege escalation**, **domain controller exploitation**, and **password cracking** in Active Directory environments.
  - Familiar with tools like **BloodHound**, **Mimikatz**, **Impacket**, and custom scripts for exploiting AD vulnerabilities.
  
- **Red Teaming & Offensive Security**:
  - Skilled in **attack simulation**, **lateral movement**, and **post-exploitation** using frameworks such as **Cobalt Strike**, **Metasploit**, and **Empire**.
  - Proficient in crafting **phishing campaigns**, **social engineering tactics**, and **custom malware** for testing organizational resilience.

- **Web Application Security**:
  - In-depth experience conducting **source code reviews** for **Django**, **React**, and **Node.js** applications to identify critical vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **CSRF**, and more.
  - Knowledgeable in the OWASP Top 10 and **SANS 25** security risks, ensuring web applications meet security best practices.

- **Full-Stack Development & Security**:
  - **Django**: Crafting secure, robust, and scalable backend systems with a focus on protecting sensitive data through encryption and secure authentication mechanisms.
  - **React**: Developing rich, interactive user interfaces while integrating front-end security like **Content Security Policies (CSP)** and **XSS** protection.
  - **Flutter**: Designing and securing cross-platform mobile applications with a focus on performance, usability, and security.

- **DevSecOps & Automation**:
  - Integrating security seamlessly into the **CI/CD pipelines** using tools like **SonarQube**, **Checkmarx**, and **Snyk** to automate vulnerability detection and compliance.
  - Leveraging **Terraform** and **Ansible** for automated, repeatable security configurations in infrastructure-as-code setups.
  - Monitoring and managing security in containerized environments with tools like **Aqua Security** and **Falco**.

## ‚ö° Fun Fact:
Did you know that the infamous **Heartbleed vulnerability** in 2014 could have been prevented with better secure code design? Heartbleed was a severe bug in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library, allowing attackers to read sensitive information directly from a server‚Äôs memory, including private keys and passwords. The root cause? A simple bounds-checking issue that led to a buffer over-read, which could have been avoided by implementing stricter input validation and safer memory management practices. This breach is a prime example of why secure coding principles, such as **input validation**, **memory safety**, and **code reviews**, are critical in preventing large-scale vulnerabilities.
